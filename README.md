In fields where eyes behold the land, I stand,
Witnessing the parade of power's hand.

The tractor's roar, the digital sway,
Wealthy's arrival marks the day.
From seeds to pills, they dictate our sway,
Bank loans pile, the earth they betray.
Your crops in market, they set the pay,
Months of toil, your earnings they weigh.

Factories hum, as you toil each day,
Railways and planes, you build their way.
Great dams rise, rivers they sway,
Bread, cloth, shelter, medicines they lay.
Yet your hard work, they seize and lay,
Their grip tightens, you feed their prey.

Laborers and farmers, the nation's spine,
Day and night, your work defines.
No respite, not a moment's shine,
Youth ages, old age's sign.
Under their rule, or government's line,
Your shoes, my hat, together we pine.

Your sweat drips, they count the gain,
Work harder, accumulate the strain.
Foreign coffers fill, while ours wane,
Unity in struggle, our refrain.
Jayasinh, united, let's maintain,
With mouths first, let's begin our campaign.
